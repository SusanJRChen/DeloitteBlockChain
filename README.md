# DeloitteBlockChain
Simple Block Chain implementation for Deloitte case competition during CUTC event.

First, we need to install the python dependencies:
pip install requests
pip install hashlib
pip install flask
pip install flask_cors

Next, we run the python scripts to set up the services:
python ports.py (this will launch 10 different nodes on your localhost on ports 5000,5001,5002,5003,5004,5005,5006,5007,5008,5009)
python connect.py (this will connect each node with one another)

Now we can launch the Angular website for better management of the nodes:
cd './nodeManager'
npm install (this will install all required modules for the Angular project)
npm start

The Angular website will be listning on port 4200 "http://localhost:4200"
